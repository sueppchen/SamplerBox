PiLink - OSC to midi for the Raspberry Pi
=========================================

PiLink is a simple python script that enable to route OSC messages to midi. It has been designed to be run headless on a Raspberry Pi to avoid to setup a computer between a device that sends OSC messages (like a iPad running TouchOSC) and a midi instrument.

PiLink tries to mimick some of the functionalities of the "defunc" Missing Link device.

You can configure the device by using : http://`pi_ip_address`:8080
